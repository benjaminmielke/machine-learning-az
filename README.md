# machine-learning-az
Collection of Jupyter Notebooks exploring Machine Learning through Python

### Overview
This repo holds Jupyter Notbooks and text files written to learn about Machine Learning techniques and models. Currently, there are **1** different machine learning groups covered, with **1** total model types covered, along with a Data Preprocessing section. This will be updated with new groups and models frequently. 

With each model, there is a ***Theory*** text file which can give some general, yet simple, background on the subject, a ***walkthrough*** Jupyter Notebook that uses a simple dataset to illustrate how to use the model with explantory visulatizations, and the Regression and Classifcation models will have ***templates*** that can be used to run quick model analysis. 

### How to use

Each ***walkthrough*** Jupyter Notebook will have the data set used to complete the walkthrough, therefore, the files can be downloaded and ran without issue. The ***templates*** can be used with any dataset aquired, the initial import data set cell will need to be updated by user to get the data set of choice into a dataframe. 

Here is the updated list of completed models:
