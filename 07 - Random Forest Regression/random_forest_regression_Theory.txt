Random Forest Regression
------------------------

Version of Ensemble Learning

Step 1: pick a random K data points from Traning set
Step 2: build a decision tree bsaed on these K data points
Step 3: choose number N trees you want to build and repeat steps 1 and 2
Step 4: for a new data point, each N tree predicts value of Y for new data poiint, then assigns the average of all Ntrees as the predicted value for Y. 


Ensemble Learning is more stable.
