Polynomial Linear Regression Theory

Equation
y = b0 + b1x1 + b1x1^2 + ... + bnxn^n

It is still called linear because of the COEFFICIENTS, not the xn. The coefficients are the unknowns, thus this equation is still linear. 

This is a "vesion" of multiple linear regression

When a simple linear regression does not fit well, polynomial equation can give the curve a parabolic curve effect.
